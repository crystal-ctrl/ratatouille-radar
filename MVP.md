Impact hypothesis: By better understanding rodent sighting pattern in various neighborhoods in NYC, restaurant inspectors can catch the same or more number of health code violation with less inspection conducted by better targeting city resources at what appear to be ratty-kittchen hotspots. 

From the EDA, I found a trend from the time series graph of rodent sightings that shows an increase of sighting around spring time and a decrease near winter time.

Comparing the sightings across NYC boroughs, the pattern shows that Brooklyn has the greatest number of rodent sightings in NYC.

Furuther investigating on sightings in different types of building/area, it shows the residential buildings have the most sightings.

Since most of the restaurants in NYC are in commercial buildings, I took the subset of commercial areas and compare the sighting across boroughs. The graph shows that Manhattan has the greatest number of rodent sightings in NYC commercial areas, which correlates with the pattern of past rodent violation observed at restaurant inspection.

There is more residential buildings in Brooklyn than in Manhanttan, which is why Brooklyn exhibits the highest sighting in the overall comparison.
