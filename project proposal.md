# Project Proposal

**Backstory:** 

According to this [article](https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-restaurants-go-months-without-inspections-during-coronavirus), It has been a challenge for NYC health inspectors to complete inspections for all restaurants in the past year due to the pandemic. 

**Opportunity: to help NYC public health inspectors efficiently identify restaurant health code violations** 

**Target audience: NYC Health Department**

**Impacts:**

- Increase efficiency of restaurant inspection
- Reduce rodent infestation/sighting in restaurants
- Reduce the public's exposure to foodborne illness

**Data Science Solution:**

* Build prediction model to identify which food establishments are at most risk for the types of violations most likely to spread food-borne illness

**Datasets:**

* NYC Restaurant Inspection Results - identifying patterns to predict violations
* NYC Rodent inspection data - identifying areas with higher rate of rodent sightings
* Data from social media (Yelp) - pulling out the words, phrases, ratings, and patterns that predict violations

**Impact Hypothesis:**

Using the prediction model, NYC health inspectors could catch the same or more number of restaurant health code violations with fewer inspections conducted by better targeting city resources at what appear to be dirty-kitchen hotspots.
